# -Predicting-Customer-Churn-with-Artificial-Neural-Networks

I've been working on â€“ building a Customer Churn Prediction Model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š.

Project Overview:

Objective: Predict customer churn for an e-commerce platform.
Methodology: Developed an ANN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Key Steps:
Data collection and preprocessing.
Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
Designing a neural network architecture.
Training the model on historical data.
Evaluation and fine-tuning for optimal performance.
Results:



Dealing with non-numeric features and categorical variables.
Optimizing hyperparameters for improved predictions.
Key Takeaways:

Neural networks offer powerful capabilities for customer churn prediction.
Continuous learning and experimentation are crucial in data science projects.
Next Steps:

Exploring deployment options.
Welcoming feedback and insights from the data science community.
